# Film Query Project

## Overview
I created a command-line application that retrieves and displays film data. It is menu-based, allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data.

## How To Run This Project
Run this through the console in eclipse or the terminal by going to the proper directory and type java FilmQueryApp.

## Project Description
This program prompts the user with a menu for 3 options. The user may choose to search for a film by ID number, search for films by use of a keyword or exit the program.

On either of the first two options the user is then prompted again for the corresponding input. Then is shown the output from their query. With the first option only the film with the matching ID is displayed. However, for the second option a list of films is displayed as many times multiple hits come from the keyword being searched.

The information displayed is the Title Year Rating Description and Cast. If no cast is listed then null is printed. The user is then presented a second menu asking if they would like to return to the main menu or see all details associated to the film or films found. If they choose to view them then all information is shown.

These are both called from print methods within the film query app.

## Lessons Learned 
I learned how useful and how to navigate through a database more proficiently. I can comfortably read a database schema and I am starting to be able to visualize the structure in my head a lot better now.
